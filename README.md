Gasemon is a game server monitor that can be used to send out notifications when
there are players on servers.

Uses Austinb/GameQ for game server queries and jublonet/codebird-php for Twitter
connection.

Coded with love for the Action Half-Life community.

Includes Twitter connector â€“ other type of processors should be relatively
easy to create by inheriting ServerProcessorInterface and implementing its
process method.
